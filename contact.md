## 📌 Additional Information

*Summary of LinkedIn*

From a young age, I used to visit construction sites with my dad and was always fascinated with the built environment. I remember him getting crazy about me constantly asking: “But why do they do X, dad?”. Throughout my life, I held on to this curiosity and pursued an education in Civil Engineering to find the 'why'.

During my education, I found a passion for digitalization and AI. I was fascinated by the “how” of computers learning and was fortunate enough to explore this during my thesis. Since completing my education, I have continually explored avenues for incorporating digitalization within my projects.

In my current job as a Data Analyst, I combine both my passions for the built environment and digitalization. Using data, I can answer this quest for the “why” and explain to stakeholders “how” they can optimize their business.

My specialties include a growth mindset, being a fast learner, and being both analytical and hard-working. From colleagues, I've heard that I am a great sparring partner for new ideas and for making others enthusiastic. I flourish in an environment where I can work with like-minded people on innovative ideas and projects!
